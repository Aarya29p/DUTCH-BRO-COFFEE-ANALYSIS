❓ Key Business Questions & Insights
1️⃣ Which coffee types (Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, Liberica) generate the most revenue and profit?
Arabica is the highest revenue-generating coffee type and leads in overall sales performance.

Excelsa and Liberica follow as secondary contributors.

Robusta trails in both revenue and volume, indicating lower consumer preference.

📈 Recommendation: Prioritize Arabica in product placement, promotions, and bulk packaging.

2️⃣ What are the sales trends over time — monthly and yearly? Are there seasonal patterns?
Sales spike in March, June, and December, showing seasonal buying behavior, likely influenced by promotions and holidays.

Year-over-year data suggests a consistent upward trend, indicating positive business growth.

📈 Recommendation: Align marketing campaigns and product launches with peak months to maximize ROI.

3️⃣ Which roast types (Light, Medium, Dark) are most popular among customers?
Light and Medium roasts are the most popular, dominating sales volume across all coffee types.

Dark roast has a smaller but stable segment of loyal buyers.

📈 Recommendation: Focus inventory and ad spend on Light and Medium roasts. Position Dark roast as a specialty offering.

4️⃣ What is the performance of different product sizes in terms of quantity sold and profitability?
2.5 kg pack is the best-performing size, leading in both quantity sold and revenue contribution.

0.5 kg and 1.0 kg sizes follow in volume, but with less revenue impact.

0.2 kg packs are lowest in both sales and profit.

📈 Recommendation: Prioritize 2.5 kg and optimize smaller sizes through bundling or repositioning.

5️⃣ Which individual products are top sellers by both quantity and revenue?
Arabica 2.5 kg stands out as the top-selling individual product, dominating both in units sold and total revenue.

Other consistent performers include Excelsa 1.0 kg and Liberica 0.5 kg, though with lower profit margins.

📈 Recommendation: Expand availability and promotions for top SKUs, especially Arabica 2.5 kg.
